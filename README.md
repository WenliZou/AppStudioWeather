Add page 2 map view. Pop up when click on location name on page 1. Autometically zoom to the location. 

Add search function. Search box appears when click on search button on page 1. Enter a city name and press enter to search for the weather info for that city. Search box disappear after press enter key. Or click on search button again to close it without sending query. 

Add refresh function. Click on refresh button on page 1 to refresh weather info. (But openweatherapi refresh their data every 10 minutes. So the results may not change if you click the button within 10 min)
